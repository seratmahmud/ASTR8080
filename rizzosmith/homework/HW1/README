#HW1 information
ASTR 8080

This script shouold be run for the UNIX command terminal and takes a minimum of 3 parameters
When running the code the required variables are:

Start Date in format, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM' The script will plot the yearly positons at the date and time entered as well as 12 hours later, for the next 10 years.

Planets in the format, 'Planet'. Multiple planets can be entered and they should be separated via a space. i.e 'Mercury' 'Venus' etc... 

Month in either integer with no leading zero (ex. 1) or as a float with leading zero and decimal (ex. 01.). This is the month for which the optimal quasar from the HW1quasarfile.dat file will be calculated. This script assumes that 'HW1quasarfile.dat' is present in the directory that the script is running from. 
The lowest possible airmass observation will return quasar coordinates and observation date.
 

#----- Example running the program from command line-------

python HW1.py '2020-01-01 14:00' 'Mercury' 'Venus' 'Mars' 'Jupiter' 'Saturn' 9

#----------------------------------------------------------

If you enter less than the required 3 parametrs the script will yell at you and refuse to run.

All code is written in the HW1.py file.

If importing these function for future use. The logic flow in writing planets_eccliptic and planets_equatorial is not optimized for importing separately.
planets_equatorial requires an input parameter of positions of the planets passed to the script. planets_ecliptic returns these positions for use to convert to equatorial. If needed in the future it would be a straightforward fix to calculate the positions inside both function such that they can be called independently from eachother.
