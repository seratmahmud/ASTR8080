### Overview
This Python project calculates areas of fields on the celestial sphere and populates them with random points. It further processes a list of quasars, determining their HEALPix pixel numbers at different resolutions, and visualizes these quasars on a plot, highlighting areas with higher densities.

### Requirements
- Python
- Astropy
- Healpy
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

### Setup and Execution
1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Ensure you have the `.py` script and `HW1quasarfile.dat` file to your local machine.
