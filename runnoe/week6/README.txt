Happy Tuesday! 

Today you are learning about spherical caps. The notes are in the usual places on the website and in the Git respository. You can find a video with a brief description of the tricky parts on Brightspace. If you look under "Content>Videos" you should find it listed under "Lecture for Feb 13". You can also find a link to it on the class website under week6 links, or you can go here:
