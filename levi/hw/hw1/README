I am not sure what to put here! the file assumes that the quasar data file is in the same
directory as the script. I didn't git add in case the file was large. Let me know if the 
data file should be added usually. All time formats are in yyyy-mm--ddThh:mm:ss where hh is in 24hr
format. all the functions return things, but the coordinates for the planets/10 years of
datetimes are not needed, as are the quasar coordinates. utilizes the built in python 
calendar function which is fun! the whole thing assumes mountain standard time e.g.
all times are assumed to be TIME + 7 hrs = UTC. All datetimes are returned in UTC.
All airmasses are calculated from Apache Point Observatory. print statements usually
have leading/trailing new lines to break up the warnings from generating datetimes.
The total run time for the script prints at the end. From my tests (depending on how long
you look at plots) the run time is about 10ish seconds.
