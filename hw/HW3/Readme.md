ASTR 8080 Homework 3

## Author: S. Saad

### Overview
1. This Python script generates a .ply file that contains the Mangle mask for four different spherical parts of the sky. Each part has a radius of 2 degrees. The centers of these fours parts has the following coordinates: (155, 34), (159, 36), (163, 34), and (167, 36).
2. It randomly plts 1000000 points in the whole sphere to calculate the area of the masked part.
3. It plots the quasar in the file "HW3quasarfile.dat" in a single plot with two different color for the masked region and the non masked region.

### Requirements
- Python
- Astropy
- Mangle
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

### Setup and Execution
1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Ensure you have the `.py` script and `HW3quasarfile.dat` file to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and execute the file. Write 'python hw.py'.
